- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ztelock23
- 👀 I’m interested in Blockchain development, Ethereum smart contracts, and decentralized applications (dApps). I have a passion for building secure and efficient solutions in the Web3 space.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Solidity, smart contract security best practices, and Layer 2 scaling solutions. I'm also exploring AI tools like GitHub Copilot to enhance my development workflow.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Open-source blockchain projects, particularly those focused on DeFi, NFTs, or Layer 2 solutions. I'm excited to work with others who share a vision for a decentralized future.
